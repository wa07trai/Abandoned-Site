#Jumping Ship to Linux#

A few weeks ago I decided to switch over from Windows 11 to a Linux/GNU operating system. Over the course of Windows 10 and 11, I gradually felt that the operating system I ran by default was becoming more and more "ugly". Windows has bloat in the form of Microsoft's suite of office applications and xbox related features; tons of annoying settings enabled by default; and latest of all was an announcement from Microsoft stating their AI assitant would take screenshots of a user's desktop once every four seconds or so for a feature known as Recall.So in lieu of this, I checked out a few distros. Using VirtualBox I was able to do some distro window shopping, I tested a reasonable number of distros: Mint, Ubuntu, Artix, Arch and ultimately I settled on Manjaro with an xfce desktop environment. I personally felt that this was the best in terms of appearance and the source distro, Arch. It's very quick and easy to setup linux, infact I could probably do the whole installation in <5minutes on another computer. All I needed to do was format a USB flashdrive with an ISO file of manjaro, screenshot my Windows key incase I want to reinstall (not likely), and do a backup. So far, I haven't noticed much of a difference in terms of experience. All my applications that I use in Windows are nicely ported over to GNU/Linux and things are running relatively smoothly aside from audio issues related to bluetooth. I have to get a bit more used to the terminal, I remember taking a course on computer systems in high school and it's been very helpful in terms of just navigation and setting up stuff for my website. The whole installation process over the terminal is super-duper easy though, all I have to do is just go Ctrl+Alt+T and then say "sudo pacman -S [package name]" and the package manager goes ahead and installs it. No browser required, it's that direct. 

Setup:

Currently I run Manjaro (using xfce) as my stable distro for college, but I also have GRUB to switch to Arch (using i3) when I want to play around with stuff on my computer.
